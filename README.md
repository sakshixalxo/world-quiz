# World Quiz
Welcome to the World Quiz Website! 

This project challenges users to match countries with their respective capitals through an interactive quiz. Developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the website provides an engaging and educational experience where users can test their knowledge of world geography. The quiz dynamically presents questions and evaluates user responses in real-time, offering immediate feedback on correctness and providing an opportunity to learn and reinforce geographical knowledge.

This project showcases my proficiency in front-end web development, focusing on creating a responsive and interactive learning tool. By utilizing HTML for content structure, CSS for styling and layout design, and JavaScript for quiz logic and interactivity, I've crafted a user-friendly interface that enhances engagement and knowledge retention. Whether you're exploring world capitals or testing your geography skills, the World Quiz Website offers an enjoyable way to learn and challenge yourself.
